# my-professional-portfolio
The over view of this assignment was to create a professional portfolio that would be responsive to all media sizes. Primarily from desktop-sized screen, to ipad-sized screen, to a mobile device screen. 
The languages I used in this project are HTML, CSS, along with BootStrap.
